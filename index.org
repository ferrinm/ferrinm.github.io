** Project 4: Reconstitution of endocytic actin network
*** recent progress
- now getting consistent GFP fluorescence of fixed samples by submerging
  agarose-immobilized samples in TBS instead of 1X fixative solution
- collected ROIs to try correlating for 2 +Las17 samples

- unfortunately the far-red laser line of Wall-E stopped working before I could
  start imaging any negative control samples
  - still not working after restarting several times, waiting a few days
  - Holly didn't have suggestions over email, but is supposed to be available
    next week to take a look
  - tried our airyscan and wide-field, but neither have the combination of
    objectives and bright field/fluorescence channels that I need
- went forward with processing the 2 dishes I did get to image, hopefully we can
  section and put on TEM next week to look at actin-positive beads

*** next steps
**** week of <2021-11-15 Mon>
- finish sectioning and image GFP-positive beads
- determine whether there is a difference in membrane shape between high and low
  fluorescence beads
  - come up with some metric of scoring if so
**** weeks of <2021-11-15 Mon> to <2021-12-13 Mon>
- if there are differences, collect triplicate data and do statistical test
** Project 7: Mechanical regulation of CME by protein LLPS
*** recent progress
- put together a framework for identifying mistakes in math or code and pointing
  to where they're coming from
  - turn off forces on all membrane segments except for one
  - simulate movement of the single membrane segment
    - akin to dragging a single point to a defined starting point, then letting
      go and seeing how it relaxes
  - independently calculate and plot a heatmap of the free energy landscape of
    that single segment
  - if the segment is moving downhill in free energy, the forces are being
    calculated correctly and code is written correctly
- diagnosed issue with curvature calculation:

  [[drive:1vT3fmyoIGUIhTfJ6358-_7cRiSgX6hHS]]
  - difference between mean curvature and spontaneous curvature needs to be
    squared so it can't go negative
- diagnosed issue with turgor pressure calculation:

  drive:1uuZmpzzDIpXTmKpx2SsYaNrQZhJYPl2o
  - negative volume was being calculated because z coordinates are negative in
    endocytosis visualization convention
- a temporary hack to fix the two above issue produces results that make sense

  - curvature only:

    drive:1xalUBpYt6eLSygjVL4UA-VUBIbu_poKF

  - turgor pressure only:

    drive:1xbBlz8sBVdKbHjNpzrgUOfixJdq6Rlkc
  - curvature + turgor + membrane tension combined:

    drive:1xitQWU2veBSwqR_zd7g_TogTZ3BBl7P0

*** next steps
**** short-term
- correct calculations of volume and curvature in equations and code
- add clathrin coat to model
- add droplet to model
